1. **Read the voice profile** at `voice-profile.md`
2. **Identify the content type** (see Content Templates below)
3. **Write the first draft** applying all voice profile patterns
4. **Run the Red Flags Checklist** before delivering
5. **Revise if needed** based on checklist results
6. **Deliver** the final version

## Content Templates

Adapt these templates based on the content type requested. Each template adjusts voice application for the format's conventions while keeping the core voice consistent.

### Blog Posts & Articles

- **Opening**: {{OPENING_STYLE}} - no generic hooks or "In today's world" openers
- **Structure**: {{PARAGRAPH_STRUCTURE}}
- **Transitions**: {{TRANSITION_PATTERNS}}
- **Closing**: End naturally, not with a neat bow. {{CLOSING_STYLE}}
- **Length cues**: Vary paragraph length. {{RHYTHM_DESCRIPTION}}

### Emails & Work Communication

- **Tone**: Same voice but calibrated for the audience
- **Opening**: Get to the point. No "I hope this email finds you well" unless that's in the voice profile
- **Structure**: Front-load the key information or request
- **Sign-off**: Match the formality of the relationship

### Social Media

- **Length**: Adapt voice to the platform's constraints
- **Emoji**: {{EMOJI_PROFILE}}
- **Hooks**: Use {{PROFILE_NAME}}'s natural opening style, compressed
- **Voice density**: In short form, the most distinctive voice markers should be concentrated

### Documentation & Technical Writing

- **Tone**: Slightly more structured but still recognizably {{PROFILE_NAME}}
- **Jargon**: {{TECHNICAL_VOCAB}}
- **Explanation style**: {{EXPLANATION_STYLE}}
- **Formatting**: Use headers and lists where they help, not as decoration

## Red Flags Checklist

Run this check on every piece of content before delivering. If any flag triggers, revise that section.

### Phrase Check
Scan the output for any phrase on the Forbidden Patterns list. Common offenders:
- [ ] Hedging qualifiers ("It's worth noting", "It bears mentioning")
- [ ] Generic openers ("In today's...", "In an era of...")
- [ ] Overblown attribution ("serves as a testament to", "speaks volumes")
- [ ] Forced engagement ("Let's dive in", "Let's unpack")
- [ ] Setup labels ("The key insight:", "The important thing:", "The reality is:")
- [ ] Empty emphasis ("truly", "remarkably", "groundbreaking")

### Structure Check
- [ ] No forced rule-of-three groupings (if rejected)
- [ ] No formal stacking connectors as paragraph openers (if rejected)
- [ ] No negative parallelism constructions (if rejected)
- [ ] Paragraph lengths vary naturally
- [ ] Opening matches {{PROFILE_NAME}}'s style, not a generic hook

### Tone Check
- [ ] Not excessively positive or artificially optimistic
- [ ] Conviction level matches profile (not over-hedged, not falsely certain)
- [ ] Emotional range matches the topic (frustration sounds real, enthusiasm is specific)
- [ ] Humor/irony used appropriately per profile

### Metrics Check
- [ ] Average sentence length is near {{AVG_SENTENCE_LENGTH}} words (within +/- 4)
- [ ] Sentence length varies (burstiness ratio near {{BURSTINESS_RATIO}})
- [ ] Contraction rate matches profile (~{{CONTRACTION_RATE}})
- [ ] First-person frequency matches profile (~{{FIRST_PERSON_RATE}})

### Final Read
- [ ] Read the output aloud mentally. Does it sound like a person or a language model?
- [ ] Would {{PROFILE_NAME}} recognize this as something they could have written?
- [ ] Is there any sentence that feels "generated" rather than "written"?

## Revision Strategy

When a red flag triggers:

1. **Identify the problematic pattern** (phrase, structure, or tone)
2. **Check the voice profile** for what {{PROFILE_NAME}} would naturally use instead
3. **Rewrite the sentence** using {{PROFILE_NAME}}'s patterns, not a generic alternative
4. **Re-check** the revised sentence against the checklist

Example:
- **Flagged**: "This groundbreaking approach serves as a testament to the team's dedication."
- **Profile says**: Direct, specific, low on empty emphasis
- **Revised**: "The approach worked. The team shipped it in three weeks and cut errors by half."

## Calibration Notes

{{CALIBRATION_NOTES}}
<!-- Example: "This profile was built from short-form writing samples (50-150 words each). Long-form content (1000+ words) may need rhythm adjustments - the burstiness that works in paragraphs can feel choppy across pages. When writing long-form, let some sentences run longer than the profile average to maintain flow." -->
